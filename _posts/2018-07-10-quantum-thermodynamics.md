Thermodynamics has been highly successful, impacting strongly on the natural sciences and enabling the development of technologies that have changed our lives, from fridges to jet planes. Until recently, it was applied to large systems described by the laws of classical physics. However, with modern technologies miniaturizing down to the nanoscale and into the quantum regime, testing the applicability of thermodynamics in this new realm has become an exciting technological challenge.

As a result the field of quantum thermodynamics has recently started to blossom, fuelled by new, highly controlled quantum experiments, the availability of powerful numerical methods, and the development of novel theoretical tools, for instance in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and quantum information theory. Important goals of the field are, among others, (i) a better understanding of thermalization in quantum systems, (ii) the characterization of non-equilibrium fluctuations in the quantum regime, and (iii) the design and realization of new experiments exploring quantum thermodynamics using, for example, nuclear spins, cold atoms, trapped ions and optomechanic setups.

Progress in the field of quantum thermodynamics and ultimately the resolution of technological challenges relies crucially on merging expertise from different fields, such as statistical physics, mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory. The aim of this 'focus on' collection is to form an extensive open-access resource spanning across the different areas that today make up research in this exciting field. Contributions present new experimental data, derive new results, argue for new perspectives on recent results, and establish new connections between different approaches.

Topics of the **quantum thermodynamics** include:

* role of quantum correlations in thermodynamics;
* quantum aspects of thermalization;
* quantum trajectories;
* work, heat and the second law;
* efficiency of quantum engines;
* thermodynamic control of quantum systems;
* quantum heat transport.
