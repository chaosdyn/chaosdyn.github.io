*Begin in Chapter 1 with a brief, general introduction to what the rule of law means to people in Britain and other liberal democracies today, and to why it is important. Chapter 2 identifies some historical milestones on the way to our current conception of the rule of law. In the choice of milestones I am highly selective and shamelessly Anglocentric. Others  more learned  than I would choose different historical events, and cast their net more widely. But I stand by my selection, eccentric though some of my choices amay appear to be, because the British have a history in this field of which they have every reason to be immensely proud, and I do not think it is as well known as it should be. Part II, comprising Chapter 3-10, is the heart of the book ,and in these chapters I seek to break down my every general definition of the rule of law into its constituent parts. Part III covers general topics, Chapter 11 the impact of terrorism on the rule of law: are the rules of the game changing, as Tony Blair suggested? In Chapter 12 I discuss the interaction of parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law: a knotty problem, since parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law are usually said to be the two fundamantal principles underlying our constitution in the UK, but they may not be entirely harmonious bedfellows.*
