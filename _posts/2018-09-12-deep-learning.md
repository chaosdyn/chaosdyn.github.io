* **Deep learning is a mathematical framework for learning representations from data, technically, a multistage way to learn data representations.** 
* **Two essential characteristics of how deep learning learns from data: the incremental, layer-by-layer way in which increasingly complex representations are developed, and the fact that these intermediate incremental representations are learned jointly, each layer being updated to follow both the representational needs of the layer above and the needs of the layer below. Together, these two properties have made deep learning vastly more successful than previous approaches to machine learning.**
* **Two techiniques you should be the most familiar with in order to be successful in applied machine learning today: gradient boosting machines, for shallow-learning problems; and deep learning, for perceptual problems.**
