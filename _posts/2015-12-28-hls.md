*This book is about my first year as a student at the Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The fact that the year's events took place at Harvard -- the oldest, largest, and perhaps most esteemed of America's law schools -- does not in the end differentiate my experience much from that ofthe nearly 40,000 Americans who begin their legal education every fall. The first year at American law schools tends to be remarkably uniform. The course of study has changed little in past century. Almost every first-year student is required to take what are generally thought of as the basic subject -- the law of Contracts, Torts, and Property, and Criminal Law, Civil Procedure. Nor does the manner of instruction vary much from place to place. Study focuses on selected court cases from which students are expected to deduce legal principles and the classes are usually conducted by the so-called "Socratic method", in which individual students are interrogated at length about their impressions of the material.*
