One appealing way to address the quantum integrability to look at the energy-level statistics. The corresponding Berry–Tabor criterion states that a quantum system is integrable if the level statistics is Poissonian. However it relies on semiclassical arguments and only concerns quantum systems with continuous d.o.f. The level statistics of the finite but large-N Dicke model is shown to be Poissonian below and Wigner–Dyson above the critical coupling. On the other hand, the level statistics of the Rabi model is neither Poissonian nor Wigner, which is characteristic of genuinely integrable models.
